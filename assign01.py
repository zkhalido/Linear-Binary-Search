Assign 01 - <Zakhaddin Khalidov>

Directions:
    * Complete the linearSearch and binarySearch functions that have been
      started below. Refer to the README.md file for additional info.

    * NOTE: Remember to add a docstring for each function, and that a reasonable
      coding style is followed (e.g. blank lines between functions).
      Your program will not pass the tests if this is not done!
